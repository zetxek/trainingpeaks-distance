# trainingpeaks-distance

I was tired of calculating the km I would need for my running routes in TrainingPeaks by hand. 
So this extension for Safari calculates the distance for a training peaks training (given pace and time)

Maybe one day it's cleaned up and published. For now it's full of XCode boilertplate, and it's as stupidly simple (and dirty) as it gets. 

Also - it adds the value to the field, but it doesn't seem to trigger it. At least it saves me the manual calculation - good enough for now!

If anyone ever arrives here and this is something useful (I doubt it) - [drop an issue](https://github.com/zetxek/trainingpeaks-distance/issues)!

PS: [I learned how the extension/document communication works](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70705560/570087).
