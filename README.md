# trainingpeaks-distance

I was tired of calculating the km I would need for my running routes in TrainingPeaks by hand. 
So this extension for Safari calculates the distance for a training peaks training (given pace and time)

Maybe one day it's cleaned up and published. For now it's as stupidly simple (and dirty) as it gets.
